Built-in Bitlash Scripts

This feature allows you to add built-in scripts at compile time.  

The scripts are stored in flash in the table defined below.  

Add your entries before the sentinel at the end, in pairs, using the BUILT_IN define: 
one string for the name, one string for the script.  

The BUILT_IN macro supplies the necessary null terminations.

NOTE WELL: The table is searched _last_ among all the spaces, so any function defined anywhere
will override the value in the table here.  This means you can easily shoot yourself in the foot, 
like this, from the command line:

	> function high {return low}
	
... for an endless supply of interesting debugging experiences.  Be careful.
