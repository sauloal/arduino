xbeeconfigure -- a tool to configure XBee modules

Requirements
------------

 * "GUI for Processing"
   This needs to be installed if you are running the tool
   from within Processing.
   <http://www.lagers.org.uk/g4p/distribution/web/>

Features
--------

 * Auto-detect baud rate -- If an XBee module has been configured at
   1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 or 115200 this tool
   will determine the correct speed to communicate at in order to
   reconfigure it. (It checks them in rough order of likely use so it's
   not much slower than specifying it directly and it means you don't
   have to remember/know the existing baud rate.)

 * Configuration settings file -- 

Usage
-----

Connect your XBee module to the SparkFun USB Explorer board and then
connect the board to your computer. (If you do not connect the board
before running the tool the serial port will not appear in the pop-up
list.)

Now run the xbeeconfigure tool.


= How to: Reset to default configuration =

 * Select the correct serial port from the pop-up menu.

 * Click on the "Configure as Receiver" button and wait for it to turn
   from yellow back to blue.

 * Hopefully the configuration will have been successful. The Processing
   console (or possibly system log) will contain a message if it was not
   successful.


= How to: Change the communication speed (baud rate) =

(Note that this preserves all the other existing configuration
settings.)

 * Select the correct serial port from the pop-up menu.

 * Select the desired baud rate from the pop-up menu below the "Set
   baud rate button".

 * Click on the "Set baud rate button" button and wait for it to turn
   from yellow back to blue.

 * Hopefully the configuration will have been successful. The Processing
   console (or possibly system log) will contain a message if it was not
   successful.


= How to: Configure for Wireless Bootloading =

 * Select the correct serial port from the pop-up menu.

 * The configuration that ships with the script is designed to be used
   for wireless bootloading. This means one XBee needs to be configured
   as a "Transmitter" and the other as a "Receiver". This will allow the
   Arduino reset signal to be sent to the Arduino.

 * Click on the "Configure as Transmitter" or "Configure as Receiver" button
   and wait for it to turn from yellow back to blue.

 * Hopefully the configuration will have been successful. The Processing
   console (or possibly system log) will contain a message if it was not
   successful.
